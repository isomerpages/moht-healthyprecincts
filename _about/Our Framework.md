![](/images/green%20pastel%20minimalist%20perfect%20job%20venn%20diagram%20graph%20.png)

It postulates that a healthy precinct should:

* Create environments that facilitate healthy living  
    
* Grow an activated community of residents with the interest and enthusiasm to sustain wellness and health-promoting behaviours  
    
* Facilitate a caring and supportive health and social service ecosystem to support and sustain health for all residents  

*Reach out to us should you wish to adopt and/or adapt the HPF in your community!*
