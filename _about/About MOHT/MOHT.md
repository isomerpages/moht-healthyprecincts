**MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)** is an MOH unit with a mission to shape the future of healthcare in Singapore.

##### ***Our Approach***

We identify, develop and experiment with game-changing, systems-level concepts and innovations in the promotion of good health, prevention of illnesses and delivery of care. 

We adopt an agile, collaborative approach with stakeholders and partners, using sandboxed test-beds and pilots in a small number of areas where fundamental change is critical for the effective transformation of the healthcare system, with the intention to scale these across the public healthcare system if successful.
  
##### ***Healthy Precincts***

**Healthy Precincts** is one of the key initiatives of MOHT, under the **Integrated Health Promotion (InHealth) Programme**.

MOHT InHealth focuses on novel strategies to
* Improve health
* Promote and sustain behaviour change
* Prevent the onset and progression of disease amongst the population

It aims to achieve this through co-creating Healthy Precincts with stakeholders and partners.

Through the conceptualisation and development of Healthy Precincts, behavioural frameworks, models and tools are introduced and offered to stakeholders and partners to adopt, adapt and/or collaborate on further enhancements.
