### **Integrated Health Promotion**

The **InHealth programme** focuses on novel strategies to:<br>
a) improve health<br>
b) promote and sustain behaviour change<br>
c) prevent the onset and progression of disease amongst the population

The InHealth team works closely with government, community and private sectors to embed ‘health in all policies’ and shape the socio-environmental determinants of health. 

It aims to contribute to a healthy Singapore, where community norms are shifted and every individual is able to achieve and sustain physical, mental and social well-being.
