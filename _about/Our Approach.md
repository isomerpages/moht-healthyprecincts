### **Our Approach**

To improve the health of our population, it is important that communities and individuals are empowered to take charge of their own health.

Therefore, [MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)](https://moht.com.sg/)&nbsp;has launched ***Healthy Precincts*** to foster an environment and build a culture that supports individuals to achieve and sustain healthy lifestyles.  

The *Healthy Precinct* was first piloted in Boon Lay using a precinct-based approach which involves deep engagement with residents to understand their health-seeking behaviours. The Healthy Precinct team collaborates closely with theGovernment, Grassroots Organisations (GRO), health and social care partners and communities to co-create acitivities tailored to the needs of residents. This includes:  

*   Creating conducive&nbsp;environments&nbsp;that facilitate healthy living  
    
*   Growing an&nbsp;activated community&nbsp;of residents with the interest and enthusiasm to sustain wellness and health-promoting behaviours  
    
*   Convening an&nbsp;integrated care and support ecosystem&nbsp;to support and sustain health for all residents
