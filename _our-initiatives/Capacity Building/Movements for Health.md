**Movements for Health (M4H)** represents a ground-up approach that harnesses the momentum of social movements to sustain behaviour change for better health.

M4H focuses on *raising awareness of health, and encouraging the adoption and advocacy of healthy behaviours* in the community.


**Community Movement Champions**

Our Community Movement Champions (CMCs) are ground-up initiatives that empower and mobilise the community members to live a good life:
* 3Pumpkins
* Beyond Social Services
* Green Nudge
* Hatch
* VintageRadio.SG


**How will M4H be implemented?**
* *Capability Building*: Workshop and coaching sessions to increase CMCs’ knowledge, skills and competency in health literacy and social movements
* *Social Network and Partnership Building*: Build an ecosystem/network of support and care through Community of Practice and Community Events
* *Ongoing Evaluation*: Refine the M4H model and our CMCs' movement projects
