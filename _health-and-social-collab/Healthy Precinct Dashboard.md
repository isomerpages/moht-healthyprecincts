**Healthy Precinct Dashboard** aims to enable ***Precinct Leaders*** (primarily grassroot leadership team and volunteers) to better understand their communities across different resident demographics, built environment and community assets. 

For example, the dashboard would help identify disease hotspots and opportunities in the built environment and community assets within the neighbourhood. 

The dashboard is currently a work in progress.
