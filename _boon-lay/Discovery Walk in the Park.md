##### **What is Discovery Walk in the Park?**
An opportunity for residents to keep fit while bonding with other nature enthusiasts in guided tours. The walk incorporates useful health tips and short exercises at scenic points.  

In collaboration with ***Sport Singapore (SportSG) Active Health Team***, the “Discovery Walk in the Park” programme in Boon Lay precinct sees SportSG Active Health coaches lead walks for residents in local parks.  

This guided tour incorporates both strength and cardio training (e.g., body weight exercises like shoulder press, leg curl). 

Besides enjoying the therapeutic benefits of nature and outdoor exercise, residents will also be equipped with the knowledge, skills and motivation to organically organise and conduct similar walks for themselves and their neighbours!
