##### **What is Garden2Gather?**
Garden2Gather organiszes gardening workshops for seniors to grow edible plants. It provides an opportunity for seniors to learn a hobby together and befriend other residents.

The pilot allows senior residents to pick up gardening while connecting with like-minded enthusiasts, facilitating meaningful engagements that enhance mental wellness.

Garden2Gather is one of our winning teams from the Design4Impact challenge organised by MOHT, that brings together social-minded innovators to co-create impactful and sustainable community-owned solutions to improve the social-health community. .
