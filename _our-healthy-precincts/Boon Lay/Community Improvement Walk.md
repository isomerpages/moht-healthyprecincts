### **Community Improvement Walk**

##### **Latest Updates**
* *Community Improvement Walk in Boon Lay has been completed in 2022.*
* *Improvements are coming your way!*

##### **What is Community Improvement Walk?**
Facilitated by a guide, the **Community Improvement Walk (CIW)** allows residents to actively participate in recommending enhancements to the physical environment to improve walkability and accessibility within your neighbourhood.

CIW employed both the *Environment Audit Tool (EAT)* and SmartBFA tools during the Boon Lay CIW in September 2022. These tools look into the residentsâ€™ interaction and insights with their built environment to inform town improvements, and use crowdsourced path accessibility data to provide quicker, barrier-free navigation for wheelchair users respectively.  

The CIW brought together adults, seniors and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), as well as facilitators from various organisations, to share their insights and feedback.


##### **Jointly organised by:**
* MOHT
* Housing Development Board (HDB)
* Muscular Dystrophy Association (Singapore) (MDAS),
* OneBoonLay
* SmartBFA

With the support of ***Our Accessible City @ Boon Lay Neighbourhood workgroup*** .
