MOHT partnered with SUTD and URA in 2021, to develop the tool to be more user-friendly and accessible to communities. 

Broadly, **Environment Audit Tool (EAT-Lite)** covers 7 categories: 
1\. Wayfinding<br>
2\. Building features<br>
3\. Facilities and amenities<br>
4\. Lighting<br>
5\. Mobility<br>
6\. Outdoor spaces<br>
7\. Safety

With the help of *Glide Application*, it allows residents and volunteers to take photos and document feedback in a seamless fashion.

To date, MOHT has rolled out EAT-Lite in 3 precincts, Yio Chu Kang, Queenstown and Boon Lay.
