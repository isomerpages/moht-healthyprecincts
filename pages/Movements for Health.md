M4H focuses on raising awareness of health, and encouraging the adoption and advocacy of healthy behaviours in the community.

By tapping on the power of ground-up initiatives and social network, M4H seeks to create a collective impact and mobilise community members to live a good life.

**How will M4H be implemented?**
* *Capability Building*: Workshop and coaching sessions to increase CMCs’ knowledge, skills and competency in health literacy and social movements
* *Social Network and Partnership Building*: Build an ecosystem/network of support and care through Community of Practice and Community Events
* *Ongoing Evaluation*: Refine the M4H model and our CMCs' movement projects
